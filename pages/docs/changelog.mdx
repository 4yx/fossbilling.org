# FOSSBilling Changelog

## 0.3.0 (Upcoming with no release date)
Important: this version of FOSSBiling removes quite a few deprecated functions and as such this release has the possibility to break custom themes and modules.
Please read the breaking changes below for information on what was removed and how you can update custom code if you were using them.

### Breaking Changes
 - Removed `get_mime_content_type` from the `Box_Tools` class
 - Removed the `getApiAdmin`, `getApiGuest`, and `getApiClient` functions for all classes. The DI should be used instead (example: `$this->di['api_admin'];`)
 - Removed the following API routes:
   - `/client/client/get`. Now use `/client/profile/get`
   - `/client/client/update`. Now use `/client/profile/update`
   - `/client/client/api_key_get`. Now use `/client/profile/api_key_get`
   - `/client/client/api_key_reset`. Now use `/client/profile/api_key_reset`
   - `/client/client/change_password`. Now use `/client/profile/change_password`
   - `/client/client/logout`. Now use `/client/profile/logout`
   - `/admin/staff/profile_get`. Now use `/admin/profile/get`
   - `/admin/staff/profile_logout`. Now use `/admin/profile/logout`
   - `/admin/staff/profile_update`. Now use `/admin/profile/update`
   - `/admin/staff/profile_generate_api_key`. Now use `/admin/profile/generate_api_key`
   - `/admin/staff/profile_change_password`. Now use`/admin/profile/change_password`
 - Removed the `/client/me` route, clients should go to `/client/profile` to edit their profile.
 - Removed undocumented and deprecated `same_invoice` option in `refundInvoice`.
 - Removed the functionality from the license module that allowed it to handle legacy / deprecated API formatting.
 - Removed the deprecated `param` function from the `Admin` class.

### Changes
 - All usage of the `bbmd` twig filter has been replaced with the `markdown` filter. The `bbmd` filter is now marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.
 - Made the add funds limit exceptions more specific.
 - Remove references to Walking Pixel's defunct website from Huraga.
 - Gender options for clients have been updated to include 'non-binary' and 'other' as options, and our default profile page now allows this to be updated by the client.
 - Added a link to the admin password reset page.

### New features
 - All FOSSBiling exception classes can now be translated.
 - We've added the ability to have plural translations with the `__pluralTrans` function.
 - Settings routes are now translatable for our default modules.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed the usage placeholders in translations

## Version 0.2.10 (1-26-2023)
This version comes with some bug fixes and security improvements, most notably with the Stripe payment adapter.
As always, create a fully backup of your installation before updating and if possible perform tests outside of your live environment. 

### Security
- The Stripe payment adapter has been updated to their latest SDK.
  - In the process, the adapter has been updated to have better payment status verification, preventing faked transactions from being accepted.
  - The latest version of the adapter also features a much prettier looking payment screen and now works with 3d secure authentication.
- With previous behavior from BoxBilling, generated web server credentials were stored inside the database, this has now been replaced with the asterisks key, with the intention of the row being completely removed in the future. If you have a custom module that depended on this behavior, it will no longer work.

### New Features
- The back-end has been updated to support password resets, in the next update it will be exposed within the UI. Thank you, @wyntonfranklin
- Added a check for the PHP version before the installation screen, as some people were trying to install on unsupported versions and were getting HTTP 500 errors.

### Bug Fixes
-  On the admin login screen, we've added the version number when including the API.js file. This should help prevent issues related to cache.
- Fixed issues when trying to assign staff permissions.
- Fixed an issue with the test server connection button.
- Fixed some bad HTML causing errors when entering the domain name when creating a new order.
- Fixed an error that would be thrown if debug mode is turned on and a payment was made without the URL being set. 

### Changes
- We've started to remove multi-selects from the admin panel in favor of check-boxes for improved usability.
- Default modules labels are now translatable, helping to ensure that as much of the admin panel can be translated as possible.
- Updated document URLs and enforced the FOSSBiling naming in a few areas.
- Changed the way emails are prevented from sending with the demo module enabled. 
- Session save handlers will now only be set if headers haven't been sent.
