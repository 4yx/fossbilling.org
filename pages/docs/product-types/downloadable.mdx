## Current Status
Downloadable products do exist within FOSSBilling, but in a broken state. We highly discourage using this product type until the issues are resolved.
For those who are interested, you can check [issue](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues/877) related to this Feature.
