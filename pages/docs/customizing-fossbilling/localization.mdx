FOSSBilling can be translated into other languages.

## Installing a new language
By default, FOSSBilling includes all of the official translation files in its releases. If you have a custom translation, you can submit it to the official repository using the instructions provided in the lower steps.
To install your custom translation, simply upload the translation files to the `/locale` directory of your FOSSBilling instance and the translation will be automatically detected by FOSSBilling. 
Please note that you may need to add an entry to the `/locale/locales.php` file in order for your translation to appear with its title in its native language, although this is not required for the translation to function, and this file will be overridden when FOOSSBilling is updated.
The file structure of your newly install translation should be as follows (example for English):
  - `/locale/`
    - `/locale/en_US/`
      - `/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/`
      - `/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/messages.mo` - The compiled translation. This is needed for FOSSBilling to use the translation.
      - `/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po` - The source for the translation. This is not needed for FOSSBilling to use the translation, but it does allow developers to build off of your translation easily.

## Changing the default language

Default language can be set in config.php parameter define('LOCALE', 'en_US');
