    If you're looking to create your own extension, this documentation will tell you the bare minimum required, but looking at existing extensions will probably be necessary to get a complete idea on how to write one.

So you've decided to create an extension. Let's get started with the basics. In this guide, we'll inspect the example extension and create our own one based on that.

## How do extensions work?

### Creating a module

FOSSBilling modules all reside under the `/modules` directory. Their directory must be named as follows: 'Example'. Any other variation of capitalization will not work (Examples of invalid directory names: 'eXample', 'example').
All modules are required to have at a minimum a `manifest.json` file and a `Service.php` file.

For more information, please see the [file structure](https://fossbilling.org/docs/contribution-handbook/file-structure#modules) documentation and the [Example module](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/example-module) GitHub repository.

### Creating a payment adapter

All payment adapters should reside under the `/library/Payment/Adapter` folder. They should all extend the `Payment_AdapterAbstract` class and implement it's functions.

The `Payment_AdapterAbstract` class has inline documentation of each function to aid in the development of payment adapters. You can find the most up-to-date version of this [here](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/src/library/Payment/AdapterAbstract.php)

### Creating a domain registrar

All domain registrars should reside under the `/library/Registrar/Adapter` folder. They should all extend the `Registrar_AdapterAbstract` class and implement it's functions.

The `Registrar_AdapterAbstract` class has inline documentation of each function to aid in the development of domain registrars. You can find the most up-to-date version of this [here](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/src/library/Registrar/AdapterAbstract.php)

### Creating a server manager

All server managers should reside under the `/library/Server/Manager` folder. They should all extend the `Server_Manager` class and implement it's functions.

The `Server_Manager` class has inline documentation of each function to aid in the development of server managers. You can find the most up-to-date version of this [here](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/src/library/Server/Manager.php)
