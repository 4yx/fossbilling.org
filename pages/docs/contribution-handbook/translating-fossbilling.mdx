    We don't have up-to-date locale files uploaded to our Crowdin instance yet. You might want to wait until they are ready.

We would like FOSSBilling to be available to as many people in as many languages as possible. 

The software is primarily written in English. If you are a native or fluent speaker of another language then we could use your help with the translations.

We use Crowdin to manage translations. You can take a look at the [getting started guide](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/), and then get involved in translating at [https://translate.fossbilling.org](https://translate.fossbilling.org).
