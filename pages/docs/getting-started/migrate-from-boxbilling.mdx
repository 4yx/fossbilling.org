# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBoxOpen} /> Migrate from BoxBilling

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  A more complete migration guide is in progress. At this moment there are no major breaking changes between the last BB release and current FOSSBilling preview builds and you should not have any problems if you follow these guidelines.

  Please note that some legacy BoxBilling features, most notably forums have been deprecated in FOSSBilling (as well as in the latest BoxBilling releases). Although forum posts and user information will remain in the database after migration, they will not be displayed in any way in the new installation. 

  [See the changelog](https://fossbilling.org/docs/changelog) for more complete info.

The FOSSBilling project was forked from BoxBilling in 2022. FOSSBilling aims to provide a more stable and secure open source billing platform with a clear roadmap and more transparent governance. 

If you are currently using BoxBilling and want to migrate to FOSSBilling then you can, and we aim to make the process as simple and painless as possible.

These instructions assume that you are using the latest version of BoxBilling (4.22.1.5). If you are using an older version then it is highly recommended to update your install before migrating. 

## Instructions
<Callout type="error" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHand} />}>
  Before you do anything, make sure that you do a full backup (or two) of both the database and all files in your current BoxBilling installation.

  Not doing so will leave you with no way to restore your data if something goes wrong.

### Breaking Changes
Please note, FOSSBilling has made significant changes since forking from BoxBilling, custom themes and modules may no longer work. We recommended reading the [changelog](https://fossbilling.org/docs/changelog) to review any changes listed as a breaking change.
Most notably, we have migrated from twig 2.x to twig 3.x and changed the file names from `.phtml` to `.html.twig`. 

### Download the latest release
Download the latest release of FOSSBilling using this link: [Latest Stable Release](https://fossbilling.org/downloads/stable)

### Prepare your existing installation
<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  We have slightly changed our theming system. If you are using a custom theme for the client area, you will need to make some changes on it to get it working with FOSSBilling. A guide for that is on the way.

  Until then, join our [Discord server](https://fossbilling.org/discord) to get help.

1. Make a full backup of your database and all of the existing files and folders in your BoxBilling installation.
2. Remove the 'bb-vendor' and 'bb-themes' folders (create a backup of your theme if you are using a custom theme).
3. Rename the following folders and files to remove the `bb-` prefix:
    - `bb-data` -> `data`
    - `bb-library` -> `library`
    - `bb-locale` -> `locale`
    - `bb-modules` -> `modules`
    - `bb-uploads` -> `uploads`
    - `bb-config.php` -> `config.php`
4. Delete the following files:
    - `bb-cron.php` (you will need to update your cron job to point to `cron.php`)
    - `bb-di.php`
    - `bb-load.php`
    - `rb.php`
    - `bb-ipn.php`
    - `bb-update.php`
    - You should also delete all files and folders under `data/cache`

**Note**: In the process of updating the folder structure, `bb-ipn.php` has been renamed to `ipn.php`. If at all possible, you should create a virtual alias from `bb-ipn.php` to `ipn.php` on your server. If you cannot do this, you *must* create a copy of `ipn.php` and name it `bb-ipn.php` for old subscriptions to continue to function.

### Upload and extract the FOSSBilling files
Upload and extract the contents of the preview build archive over the files in your existing BoxBilling installation and replace any existing files.

### Remove the install folder
Delete the 'install' folder and all of the files inside it. Since you already had BoxBilling installed, you will not need to go through the FOSSBilling installer again.

### Run foss-update
Run the foss-update.php script. (ex: example.com/foss-update.php)

### Migrate the configuration file
You can either do this using either of the following methods:

- **Recommended:** Use the automated migration tool.
  1. Edit your `config.php` file and update the `twig->cache` key to point to `/data/cache` instead of `/bb-data/cache`
  2. Login to the administrator panel, go to `Extensions->Overview` in the sidebar.
  2. Navigate to the `Update FOSSBilling` tab
  3. Click the `Migrate configuration` button to run the automated config migrator.
    - The FOSSBilling interface should provide feedback if the migration went smoothly, but you can verify by opening `config.php`, you should see new configuration keys that were added. There should also now be a backup of the old config under `config.php.old`
    - Note: if you are using custom values for `locale_date_format` or `locale_time_format`, you will need to manually update these to the [datetime format](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php).
- **Not Recommended** Rename 'config-sample.php' to 'config.php' and then copy the values from your old configuration file (database name, etc.) into the new configuration file.
  - This option is discouraged as it is easier to make a mistake and have issues.
