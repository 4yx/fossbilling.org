# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faRobot} /> API wrapper in JavaScript
<Callout type="info" emoji={<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCircleInfo} />}>
  We currently are working on the wrapper. It will be available in the future. This guide also is a work in progress.
</Callout>

You can use the API wrapper in JavaScript to make requests to the API. This is very useful for themes and modules, and you should use it instead of making requests yourself.

Having a wrapper allows us to make changes to the API without having to change the code in your theme or module. This makes your code more feature-proof.

## Importing the wrapper
To use the wrapper, you need to import it.

## Making requests
### GET requests
### POST requests

## Using the data returned by the API

## Handling errors
