# Integrating FOSSBilling with WHM 
	
## Configuring WHM

FOSSBilling is integrated with WHM using it's API. We will briefly describe how to setup the WHM API, however if needed you can view the [WHM API documentation](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/development/manage-api-tokens-in-whm/).

1.Log in to WHM and Go to Development>Manage API Tokens

2.Click on Generate Token

3.Name the token (this is for you to remember what its for, like “Fossbill” or “mywebsite” etc.

4.Scroll down and go through permissions. Most of the time you don’t need to adjust this, but become familiar with what the API will have access to. 

5.Scroll to the bottom and click on “Save”. 

6.The actual token will now appear. Copy and save the token where you can reference it later, as WHM will not let you view the token again. 

7.Now go to the FOSSBilling admin Panel and follow the instructions below:


## Adding a WHM server to FOSSBilling

1.  Login to your admin panel.
2.  Go to `Configuration` -> `Hosting plans and servers` from within the side panel.
3.  Go to the "New server" tab and fill out the name, hostname, and IP address, and nameservers for your server.
4.  Select the `Server manager` drop down and select WHM(cPanel) from the drop down.
5.  Enter the WHM ROOT username (NOT the name you gave the API in WHM) This is important it must be a username that you use to log into your WHM server!
6.  Enter the API key you created in the previous steps
7.  Click the add server button to save your settings and add the server to FOSSBilling.

## Hosting plans with WHM and FOSSBilling

Due to technical limitations between FOSSBilling and WHM, FOSSBilling cannot create hosting packages automatically. Because of this, you should first create the hosting plans (packages) you want to use from within WHM and define the limitations and capabilities you want it to have there, as FOSSBilling will be unable to change or define them.

Once you've created the package within WHM, you should then create it within FOSSBilling, ensuring that the package name matches exactly between the two. If it doesn't match, FOSSBilling will be unable to create accounts with that package.
