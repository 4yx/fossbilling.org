CAPTCHAs are services that protect your website from spam and disruptive behaviour. They generally use risk analysis techniques in the background to tell humans and bots apart. FOSSBilling supports Google reCAPTCHA out of the box. However, you can find other CAPTCHA providers like hCaptcha in the extension store.

CAPTCHAs usually take place in the forms end-users interact. Commonly, they take place in registration, order and contact forms.
