## Configuration

FOSSBilling comes with security features enabled and set to their maximum options by default. These options can be adjusted to be more relaxed, but it is recommended to keep them at their default values.

## Security Options

- Security Mode:
  - Default: `strict`
  - Options:
    - `strict`: 
      - Cookies are only sent over a secured connection (HTTPS)
      - Cookies have the `samesite` option set to 'strict'
      - Cookies are marked as `httpOnly`
    - `regular`: Allows HTTP connections and uses the default cookie settings for your server.
  - Configuration: Set the option `mode` in the `config.php` file.

- HTTPS Redirection: 
  - Default: `true`
  - Options: `true` or `false`
  - Configuration: Set the option `force_https` in the `config.php` file.

- Cookie Lifespan:
  - Default: `7200` seconds (2 hours)
  - Configuration: Set the option `cookie_lifespan` in the `config.php` file to the desired maximum lifespan of cookies in seconds.

## API Options

- CSRF Prevention:
  - Default: `true`
  - Options: `true` or `false`
  - Configuration: Set the option `CSRFPrevention` in the `config.php` file.
    - Note: Disabling this protection is not recommended and opens your instance to a known vulnerability. This option is only here for backwards compatibility.
