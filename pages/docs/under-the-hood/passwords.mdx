# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faKey} /> How do we store passwords?

Passwords are stored in the database using the standard PHP [password_hash](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) using the `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` algorithm (currently bcrypt).
This function will generate a strong one-way hash.
