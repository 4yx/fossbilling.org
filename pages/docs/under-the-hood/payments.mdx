# <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faMoneyBillWave} /> How do we Handle Payments?

FOSSBilling does not directly handle any payment processing and card info is **NOT** stored by FOSSBilling. 

Paymnents are processed using third-party payment processors, i.e. PayPal, Stripe, Bitcart.

Currently PayPal and Stripe integrations are working. 

The Bitcart integration is also working, and is maintained directly by Bitcart.

You can find a list of working modules here: [Working extensions and payment providers](https://fossbilling.org/docs/extensions) and we will keep that updated as more modules are tested and found to be working. 

If you need to use another payment processer, then first check the [existing issues](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/issues) and either add your comments to an existing request if one exists or start a new issue if not. If you have the ability, then please feel free to build an integration and we'd appreciate it if you would contribute the code back to FOSSBilling.
