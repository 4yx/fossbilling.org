# ⚙️ Updating FOSSBilling
There are two main ways to update FOSSBilling: manually or automatically.
Before performing either option, it is recommended to create a backup of both your database and the files to your FOSSBilling installation. 

## Using the Automatic Updater (Recommended) 

 - FOSSBilling can handle the update process automatically for you. This can be accessed by logging into your admin panel and going to `extensions` --> `overview` --> `Update FOSSBilling`. 
 - This will update FOSSBilling using whatever branch is set in the configuration file.  (preview or release) 
	 - The default option for this configuration will depend on if you have installed a preview or a release version of , but it can be changed at anytime. (more information can be found on the [config documentation](https://fossbilling.org/docs/customizing-fossbilling/config))

## Manually Updating FOSSBilling

 1. Download the latest version of FOSSBilling
 2. Extract the latest release on-top of your existing installation, overriding existing files
 3. Run yourdomain.com/foss-update.php
 4. Log in to the admin panel and go to `extensions` --> `overview` --> `Update FOSSBilling`.  Then run the `Migrate configuration` option to ensure your configuration is up-to-date.
