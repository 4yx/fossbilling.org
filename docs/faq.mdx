# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is FOSSBilling stable?

FOSSBilling is very much a work in progress. Right now we are busy squashing a lot of bugs and at the same time working on a major rewrite of large sections of the codebase. 

The last release and the latest commits should work and should be relatively stable and secure but we don't really recommend using it on production sites just yet. If you do be aware that there may be breaking changes somewhere in the near future but that we will try to make migration to future versions as easy as possible.

## When will FOSSBilling have [the magincal feature I want]?

We would love it if FOSSBuilding could do everything that everyone will ever ask of it, but in the real world that just isn't possible. The main focus of the team at the moment is to make sure that the basics are right and that FOSSBilling is stable and secure.

Even though the specific thing that you particularly need might not be available in core, FOSSBilling is designed to be easily extendable. If you have the knowledge to build an extension yourself then we would love the contribution, if not then we recommend reaching out to the community and seeing if someone else will be willing to build or update it for you.
