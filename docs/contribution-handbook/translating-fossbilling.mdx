# üåç Translating FOSSBilling

We would like FOSSBilling to be available to as many people in as many languages as possible. 

The software is primarily written in English. If you are a native or fluent speaker of another language then we could use your help with the translations.

We use Crowdin to manage translations. You can take a look at the [getting started guide](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/), and then get involved in translating at [https://translate.fossbilling.org](https://translate.fossbilling.org).
