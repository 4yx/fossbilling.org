## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following installed. Please take a moment now to make sure you are ready:
* nginx ([guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-nginx). Please skip the "Setting Up Server Blocks" part, we'll cover that in this guide)
* PHP 8.0 and later ([guide to install 8.1 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-php-8-1-and-set-up-a-local-development-environment-on-ubuntu-22-04))
* The following PHP extensions (the guide above also has a section that covers installing PHP extensions): `pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `zlib`, `gettext`, `openssl`
* MariaDB 10.3 or later, or MySQL 8 or later ([guide to install MariaDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-mariadb))
