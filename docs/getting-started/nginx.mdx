# :gear: Install on an nginx server
nginx is a pretty popular pretty popular web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. In this guide, we'll guide you through installing FOSSBilling on an nginx server.

:::info

This guide will install the latest **preview release**. If you're planning to contribute to the development of FOSSBilling, it's strongly advised to build FOSSBilling from the main branch instead.

:::

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following installed. Please take a moment now to make sure you are ready:
* nginx [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-nginx). Please skip the "Setting Up Server Blocks" part, we'll cover that in this guide)
* PHP 8.0 or later [guide to install 8.1 on Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-php-8-1-and-set-up-a-local-development-environment-on-ubuntu-22-04))
* The following PHP extensions (the guide above also has a section that covers installing PHP extensions): `pdo_mysql`, `curl`, `zlib`, `gettext`, `openssl`
* MariaDB 10.3 or later, or MySQL 8 or later ([guide to install MariaDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-mariadb)) 

## Instructions

If you need help writing your nginx config file, or just want to check what you have, then you can use the [Configuration file generator](https://config.fossbilling.org/)

### Create a server block (virtual host) for your website
* Locate the following directory: `/etc/nginx/sites-available`
* Create an empty config file (i.e `fossbilling.conf`) 
* Copy the example config from [GitHub](https://github.com/FOSSBilling/FOSSBilling/blob/main/data/nginx.conf)
* Edit the config to match your needs (Replace server name, add the PHP Fast CGI Pass, replace `fastcgi_pass php;` with `fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/phpx.x-fpm.sock;` or any of the examples shown below) 
* fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/phpx.x-fpm.sock; , fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/phpx.x-fpm.sock;
* Change anything else you may need (SSL certificates, changing ports, etc)  
* Change servername to your domain (i.e fossbilling.example.com) 
* Run `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
### Installing FOSSBilling
