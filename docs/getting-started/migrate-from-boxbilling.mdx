# :gear: Migrate from BoxBilling

:::info

A more coplete migration guide is in progress. At this moment there are no major breaking changes between the last BB release and current FOSSBilling preview builds and you should not have any problems if you follow these guidelines.

:::

The FOSSBilling project was forked from BoxBilling in 2022. FOSSBilling aims to provide a more stable and secure open source billing platform with a clear roadmap and more transparent governance. 

If you are currently using BoxBilling and want to migrate to FOSSBilling then you can, and we aim to make the process as simple and painless as possible.

These instructions assume that you are using the latest version of BoxBilling (4.22.1.5). If you are using an older version then it is highly recommended to update your install before migrating. 

## Instructions

:::caution

Before you do anything, make sure that you do a full backup (or two) of both the database and all files in your current BB installation. 

:::

### Download the latest preview build

Download the latest preview build of FOSSBilling from GitHub using this link: [Latest Preview Build](https://fossbilling.org/downloads/preview)

### Prepare your existing installation

Make a full backup of your database and all of the existing files and folders in your BoxBilling install. 

Remove the 'bb-vendor' and 'bb-themes' folders.

### Upload and extract the FOSSBilling files

Upload and extract the contents of the preview build archive over the files in your existing BB install. 

### Set up the configuration file

You can either do this using either of the following methods:

* Rename 'bb-config-sample.php' to 'bb-config.php' and then copy the values from your old configuration file (database name, etc.) into the new configuration file. 
* Copy your old 'bb-config.php' file from your backup to the new directory.
  * If copying the old configuration file, you need to change `locale_date_format` to `'l, d F o'` and change `locale_time_format` to `' G:i:s'` (please note the space before the 'G')

### Run bb-update

Run the bb-update script.

### Remove the installer files

Delete the 'install' folder and all of the files inside it.
