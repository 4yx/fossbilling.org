# :shield: Multi-factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)
Multi-factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security in addition to passwords. Think of it as hacing two locks on the door to your house that both need to be opened before you can get in, it's an additional security step you need to complete after entering your password, that could be with a code via SMS, with Google Authenticator, Authy, or another app, or wuth a hardware key.

FOSSBilling does not support MFA at this time, but it is on the roadmap and will arrive with the 1.0.0 release or before.
